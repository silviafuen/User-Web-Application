# Simple User Web Application

A complitation of a recent class project I've worked on. This was built with Java servlets and some HTML/CSS for the formating and styling. 

The web based application will support a series of pages that allows a user to: 
- Log in using a user name and a password 
- Select from a menu to either edit or display user preferences 
- Log out
